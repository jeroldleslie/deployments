Hardware: kafka = 3 x 2GB, hadoop worker = 3 x 4GB
Message : size = 512 
Dataflow: worker = 2, executor per worker = 2, num of stream = 8 and 10

1*: - Fail 1 time due to the container allocation problem. This problem is seen for long time and we do not quite understand about the problem.
      Even move to use hadoop 2.7.1.

2*: - Fail few time due to container allocation problem. 
    - When run successfully, many executor are broken due to kafka reader can get the leader. Probably under the heavy test, kafka is too busy. 
      Update code so the kafka partition reader can retry to connect to avoid the broken problem(probably there is a problem with kafka setting
      and it allows only a number of connection. Our test have many thread that connect to kafka, depend on the number of streams but this 
      problem is not seen offen probably it happens only when digitalocean is not well performed).
    - Run successfully after fix the kafka reader

3*: - The test is setup with 30 kills, but in fact the test finish in 55m and can execute only 20 kills 

4*: - First run fail due to an exception that never seen. The problem look like come from the zookeeper broken connection

5*: - First run successfully, but has many executor error due to the problem that kafka cannot connect even after 3 retries. The problem happen
      only the system process few million messages, and this problem is not seen before. The previous test we run before use 10 partitions while
      this test use 8 partitions.


6*: - The failure simulation has no lost messages. But there are number of the duplicated messages. The test kill randomly a worker for every 
      2 min for 30 times. The bad performance mainly come from the imbalance as for the last few tasks, the simulator keep kill the same worker 
      as there is only one worker left.

Other: - Imbalance problem can come from the distribution of master. We have a lot of master due to the design. 
       - Imbalance can come from distribution of workers. One dataflow can run faster and finish before the other.

Hardware: kafka = 6 x 2GB, hadoop worker = 6 x 4GB
Message : size = 512 
Dataflow: worker = 2, executor per worker = 3, num of stream = 16 

1*: - First run is setup with 3 executors per worker and it takes about 833s

2.* - 1 container allocation problem

3.* - First run cannot finish due to all the worker of one dataflow exist. The suspect problem is when when the workers are killed 
      randomly, the task is broken and it stay in the running list. When new worker is launched, it cannot grab any task and exists, 
      before the master detect and move the task back to the avaialable list.
    - Seen lost error(UNKNOWN AND DANGEROUS BUG)

Other: - Try to build cluster with london region and fail 3 times. Move to sgp region
       - After about 630 - 650s, the dataflows are already processed all the messages, but it takes about 744s to finish as there is the
         overhead to check to make sure that there is no more messages and shutdown. 
       - Less problem with yarn container allocation
